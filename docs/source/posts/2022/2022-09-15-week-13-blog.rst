What did you do this week?
--------------------------

This week I managed to fix all the issues with skeletal animations and we get to see our first render of skeletal animation :).

- Implemented hierarchical timeline system (ie, one timeline for each bone and the timeline will contain its parent timeline in a hierarchy).

- I figured out that we don't really need to apply the parent transform as we're actually applying it the vertex data while forming the actor. So the skin matrix becomes
``SkinMatrix = InverseBindPose * BoneDeform`` where ``BoneDeform = CurrentBoneTransform * ParentBonetransform``.

Here's a preview using the ``CesiumMan`` model:


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Fixing the camera issue (As of writting this blog it's done)

- Add tests for simple animation PR `#643`_.

- Multiple actor support for skeletal animation.

- Take a look at Morphing.


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- No, I didn't get stuck this week.
