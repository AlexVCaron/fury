What did you do this week?
--------------------------

As decieded in last week, I added support for multiple aimations at same timestamp. But this didn't solve the animation problems of ``RiggedSimple`` model.

- I figured out that I was not applying the the global transform of joints in the skinning matrix causing the joints to move to a new position. I referred to this `answer by irradicator<https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/703803-gltf-skinning-matrix-calculation/>`.

- We had to invert the multiplication order  (ie, ``np.dot(skin_mat, vertex)`` instead of ``np.dot(vertex, skin_mat)``) for this model. We still need to figure out from where do we get the multiplication order of the two.

- I also tried to create a custom Interpolator that does all calulations required for vartex skinning, However we couldn't get this working. I got a few suggestions from Mohamed in our meeting, I'll try to implement those.

- Added tests for animations.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Adding more tests.
- Fixing the Interpolator.
- Order of multiplication in skinning matrix.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

No, I didn't get stuck this week.
