What did you do this week?
--------------------------

- This week, I started with Multiple actor support in skinning, Managed to do it
  successfully (see brainStem Model)

- Implementing multiple animation channels support (as seen in the ``Fox`` model). The ``get_skin_timelines()`` method now returns a dictionary of all animation channels with Timeline as their value.

- We merged two PRs, `#689`_ (colors from Material) and `#643`_ (simple animations).

- Added ability to load morphing information and create timelines from it. Here's a preview of the ``AnimatedMorphCube`` and ``AnimatedMorphSphere``models:
