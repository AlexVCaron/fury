What did you do this week?
--------------------------

This week I had to fix the transformation issue in glTF animation. As discussed in last meeting I disabled vertex transformation
and applied the transformation after the actor is formed.

- Creating transformation matrix as it is.
- Extract translation, Rotation and Scale matrice from the transformation matrix.

I also started investigating more on the skinning animation.

- I created functions to extract and apply the ``InvertBindMatrices`` to the vertices.
- Also applying the ``globalTransformMatrices`` to the mesh.


What is coming up next week?
----------------------------

- Skeletal animations support


Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------

- Even after applying transformation to the actor, after it's created. Some models did not behave as intended. We still need to figure this issue out and fix it.
