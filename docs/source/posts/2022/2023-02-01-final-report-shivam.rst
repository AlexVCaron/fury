Objectives Completed
--------------------

Loading Static glTF models
**************************


   A glTF file is a JSON like file format containing required data for
   3D scenes. VTK has two built-in glTF loaders. However, they lack
   ability to animate and apply materials. Added methods to load binary
   data and create actors from them. These actors can be added directly
   to the scene. The glTF class reads texture data from either
   ``base64`` encoded string or from the image file, and maps the
   texture to the actor using the given UV data. It is capable of doing
   the following:

   -  Loading both ``gltf`` and ``glb`` files. Get actors from the
      model.
   -  Applying textures and colors from materials.
   -  Setting cameras if the model contains multiple cameras.
   -  Apply normals (for a smoother surface).

Exporting Scene as a glTF
*************************


   The fury scene can contain multiple objects such as actors, cameras,
   textures, etc. We need to get the primitive information (such as
   Vertices, Triangles, UVs, Normals, etc.) from these objects and store
   them into a ``.bin`` file. Added methods that export these
   information to a ``.gltf`` or ``.glb`` file format.

Simple Actor Animations
***********************

   Added simple actor animations (translation, rotation & scale of
   actors) support. The animation data (transformation and timestamp) is
   stored in buffers. It converts the binary data to ndarrays and
   creates a timleline for each animation in glTF animations. This
   timeline containsactors an can be added to the scene. We can animate
   the scene by updating timline inside a timer callback.

Morphing in glTF
****************

   glTF allows us to animate meshes using morph targets. A morph target
   stores displacements or differences for certain mesh attributes. At
   runtime, these differences may be added to the original mesh, with
   different weights, to animate parts of the mesh. Added methods to
   extract this information, update the timeline and apply morphing to
   each actor in the scene.

Skeletal Animations (Skining)
*****************************

   Another way of animating a glTF is by skinning. It allows the
   geometry (vertices) of a mesh to be deformed based on the pose of a
   skeleton. This is essential in order to give animated geometry. It
   combines every parameter of a glTF file. While working with skinning,
   we need to keep track of the parent-child hierarchy of
   transformations. Vertex Skinning takes full advantage of newly
   implemented ``Timeline`` & ``Animation`` modules to track
   hierarchical transformation order. Though the current version of the
   skinning implementation works with most of the glTF sample modes, It
   struggles with models that have multiple actors (e.g.Â BrainStem). It
   can be fixed by using the vertex shader to update the vertices. The
   current implementation of skinning supports the following:

   -  Multiple animation support
   -  Multiple node and multiple actor animation with textures
   -  Show or hide bones/skeleton of the model.

Objectives in Progress
----------------------


PBR and emission materials in glTF
**********************************

   The glTF format supports Physically based rendering also. PBR allow
   renderers to display objects with a realistic appearance under
   different lighting conditions, the shading model has to take the
   physical properties of the object surface into account. There are
   different representations of these physical material properties. One
   that is frequently used is the metallic-roughness-model. We have
   various material properties already in FURY, we need to apply it to
   glTF models as well.


Skinning for models with no indices
***********************************

   The glTF format supports non-indexed geometry (e.g., the ``Fox``
   model). We currently do not know how to render the model without
   indices. I tried estimating it in this
   `branch <https://github.com/xtanion/fury/blob/gltf-indices-fix/fury/gltf.py>`__.
   However, It fails to render in skinning.

   *Branch URL:*

   -  **Rendering glTF with no indices: (in-progress)**
      https://github.com/xtanion/fury/blob/gltf-indices-fix/fury/gltf.py

Other Objectives
----------------


Fetcher for importing glTF files from Khronos-glTF-Samples
**********************************************************

   The
   `KhronosGroup/gltf-samples <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/>`__
   contain multiple glTF sample models to test a glTF viewer for free.
   Implemented new methods in fetcher that can load all of these models
   by (usind type) asynchronously. The glTF fetcher is capable
   of the following:

   -  Downloading multiple models asynchronously.
   -  Get the path to the downloaded model using it   -  Download any model using the URL of the model.
